# Recipeadia
Application is currently deployed to  https://spencerelm.github.io/Recipeadia/

An application that allows you to search our cleaned database of ~15,000 recipes based on ingredients, dietary restrictions, or duration of cooking process

Data used:

We scraped two websites for recipes: Chowhound and Food Network. We
gained approximately 2,000 recipes through this method. Scraping code can be
found in ScrapingCode/. We hope to expand our database by scraping more recipe
websites and updating our sqlite file

We also obtained a dataset with approximately 11,000 recipes from Kaggle,
